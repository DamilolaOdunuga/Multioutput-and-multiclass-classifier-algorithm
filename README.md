# Multioutput-and-multiclass-classifier-algorithm
MultiOutput Classifier consists of fitting one classifier per target which allows multiple target variable classification. The purpose of this class is to extend estimators to be able to estimate a series of target functions that are trained on a single X predictor matrix to predict a series of responses.
